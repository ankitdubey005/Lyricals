              <h4 class="verses"> [Intro: Paul Rodgers]</h4>

              Lately I've been hard to reach
              I've been too long on my own
              Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
              Are you calling me?
              Are you tryin' to get through?
              Are you reaching out for me?
              I'm reaching out for you
            </div>

            <div class="lyrics">
              <h4 class="verses"> [Verse 1: Eminem] </h4>


              I'm just so fucking depressed
              I just can't seem to get out this slump
              If I could just get over this hump
              But I need something to pull me out this dump
              I took my bruises, took my lumps
              Fell down then I got right back up
              But I need that spark to get psyched back up
              In order for me to pick the mic back up
              I don't know how or why or when
              I ended up in this position I'm in
              I'm starting to feel distant again
              So I decided just to pick this pen
              Up and try to make an attempt
              To vent, but I just can't admit
              Or come to grips with the fact that
              I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
              And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
              But I just can't sit back and wallow
              In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
              I'll be one tough act to follow
              One tough act to follow
              I'll be one tough act to follow
              Here today, gone tomorrow
              But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—
              [Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
              In my shoes, just to see
              What it's like to be me
              I'll be you, let's trade shoes
              Just to see what it'd be like to
              Feel your pain, you feel mine
              Go inside each other's minds
              Just to see what we find
              Look at shit through each other's eyes

              But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh

              Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh

              I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor
              Everything's so tense and gloom
              I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
              Of the room, just as soon as
              I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
              So I try to avoid any eye contact
              'Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
              For conversation like I want that
              I'm not lookin' for extra attention
              I just wanna be just like you
              Blend in with the rest of the room
              Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
              I don't need no fuckin' man servant
              Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
              Laugh at every single joke I crack
              And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, "Ha!
              Marshall, you're so funny, man
              You should be a comedian, goddamn!"
              Unfortunately I am
              I just hide behind the tears of a clown
              So why don't you all sit down?
              Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
              Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
              And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—

              Nobody asked for life to deal us
              With these bullshit hands we're dealt
              We gotta take these cards ourselves
              And flip 'em, don't expect no help
              Now, I could've either just sat
              On my ass and pissed and moaned
              Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
              And get up and get my own
              I was never the type of kid
              To wait by the door and pack his bags
              And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
              For a dad to show up who never did
              I just wanted to fit in
              In every single place, every school I went
              I dreamed of being that cool kid
              Even if it meant actin' stupid
              Aunt Edna always told me:
              "Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that."
              Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
              Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
              'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen
              Stop sign pole at eight-years-old
              I learned my lesson then, 'cause I wasn't
              Tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
              But I already told you my whole life story
              Not just based on my description
              'Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
              It's probably a 110% different
              I guess we would have to walk a
              Mile in each other's shoes at least
              What size you wear? I wear 10's
              Let's see if you can fit your feet—
              [Pre-Chorus: Eminem]

            <div class="facts-heading">Facts About This Song</div>

            <p class="facts-content">On this melancholy song Eminem raps about his struggles with drug addiction. In
              August 2005 Eminem entered drug rehabilitation in order to treat a dependency on sleep medication. He
              subsequently took a break during which he battled his addiction whilst industry insiders speculated that
              Shady had ended his rapping career. Eminem is now sober and he told Vibe magazine that this song is the
              only one he kept from the recordings he made during that dark period in his life. He explained: "One of
              the only reasons that I put that track on there is that I feel like it's the best song out of that batch
              that I did when I wasn't sober. At the time I felt like, 'This is it for me.' I wrote the first verse and
              a half in rehab, and when I came out, I finished it. It was the only song that marks that period without
              bringing me back to that place. Every other track not only didn't fit with the album, but when I listened
              to it, it would bring up bad memories."
              This is the only track on Relapse that Eminem produced himself.
              This samples Paul Rodgers and Queen's version of Rock Therapy's 1996 charity single "Reaching Out."
